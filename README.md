# -Project-Memory-Match-Game-with-Scoreboard-
A fun and simple card-flipping memory game where the player has to match pairs of cards. It uses HTML for structure, CSS for design/animations, and JavaScript for interactivity + scoring.  This project checks all the boxes: structured layout, good design, interactive feature, originality, and browser-only execution.
